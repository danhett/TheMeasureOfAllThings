# THE MEASURE OF ALL THINGS
A study of Islamic geometric forms, created for/during the Sheherezade residency in Lahore, Pakistan, alongside Madlab.

## What is this?
This is a self-running Processing application that explores the way in which Islamic geometric forms are created by hand, using the Handy library to render simulated sketches. The software uses three layers of SVG imagery to simuate initial pencil sketches, pen overlays, and finally colour schemes. Both the illustrator files and resulting SVG's are included in this repository. 

## What does it look like?

Here is a timelapse of it working, breaking, being fixed, and then working again:

## Dependencies
- The rendering uses the Handy library, install it from the Processing library manager. 
- Also uses the mukprojects console library so I could see errors and things while projecting and not near the laptop
- Tested on Processing 3 only but should work everywhere. - There's also a bunch of kinect stuff in there (in a separate small project) which passes information in via OSC, so those libraries are needed but can be removed (they weren't used in the final work in the end). 

## Thanks to
- Asa and Rachael at MADLABUK
- The British Council team in Pakistan
- Mattias Jones
- Lisa De Long
- every expert in Islamic geometry that shouted at me when I did it wrong (I know some are still wrong, I'm getting better though!)
- every lovely enthusiastic human that said nice things about it out in Lahore

## Licensing 
PLEASE NOTE this code is provided as-is, it's an absolute hot mess, such is the way when you write code in a massive hurry on a residency in a diffrent country on not enough sleep. I'm providing it for reference and learning and whatever else, and as such it is distributed under the extremely permissive/confrontational DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO public license, see LICENSE.md for more information.
